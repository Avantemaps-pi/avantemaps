## Type `PaymentDTO`

This type is for the arguments that are passed to `onIncompletePaymentFound` and `onError`.

```typescript
type PaymentDTO = {
  // Payment data:
  identifier: string; // payment identifier
  user_uid: string; // user's app-specific ID
  amount: number; // payment amount
  memo: string; // a string provided by the developer, shown to the user
  metadata: Object; // an object provided by the developer for their own usage
  from_address: string; // sender address of the blockchain transaction
  to_address: string; // recipient address of the blockchain transaction
  direction: Direction; // direction of the payment
  created_at: string; // payment's creation timestamp
  network: AppNetwork; // a network of the payment

  // Status flags representing the current state of this payment
  status: {
    developer_approved: boolean; // Server-Side Approval
    transaction_verified: boolean; // blockchain transaction verified
    developer_completed: boolean; // server-Side Completion
    cancelled: boolean; // cancelled by the developer or by Pi Network
    user_cancelled: boolean; // cancelled by the user
  };

  // Blockchain transaction data:
  transaction: null | {
    // This is null if no transaction has been made yet
    txid: string; // id of the blockchain transaction
    verified: boolean; // true if the transaction matches the payment, false otherwise
    _link: string; // a link to the operation on the Blockchain API
  };
};
```

```typescript
type Direction = "user_to_app" | "app_to_user";
```

## Type `AppNetwork`

Shows which network the payment is being made on.

```typescript
type AppNetwork = "Pi Network" | "Pi Testnet";
```
