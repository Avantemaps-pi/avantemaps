/**
 * Regression test for LoginDialog staying open on top of AuthenticatingOverlay's
 * terminal error card.
 *
 * LoginDialog's own try/catch only sees errors thrown by login(), but
 * performLogin() (authService.ts) swallows the 60s AuthTimeoutError and only
 * sets the context-level authError. The dialog never closed, and because Radix
 * portals it to the end of <body>, it aria-hid the "Sign-in didn't complete"
 * card underneath it — Try again / Dismiss were unreachable by mouse,
 * keyboard, or screen reader.
 *
 * Driven through /registration on purpose: Registration.tsx renders
 * LoginDialog unconditionally. The landing page is NOT a valid entry point for
 * this test — Index.tsx unmounts LandingPage (and its dialog) as soon as
 * isLoading flips true, which masks the bug.
