/**
 * Regression test for the re-auth false-success gap in reAuthAndRetry()
 * (src/hooks/useMessages.ts).
 *
 * Scenario: the user has a cached local PiUser but NO Supabase session.
 * Tapping "Message" on a business card triggers reAuthAndRetry
 * ('missing-session') → login(). login() always resolves — even when
 * authentication genuinely fails — so the old code fired a false
 * "Signed back in — resuming…" success toast and the queued conversation
 * request hung until the 15s in-flight timeout produced "Couldn't open
 * the conversation."
 *
 * The fix re-checks supabase.auth.getSession() after login() resolves;
 * with no session it shows an honest "Sign-in failed" toast and resolves
 * the queued request promptly via resolvePendingConversation().
 *
 * The genuinely-failing login is simulated without live Pi auth: the real
 * SDK script is blocked and window.Pi is stubbed with an authenticate()
 * that rejects immediately (isPiBrowser() treats a present window.Pi as
 * Pi Browser, so performLogin() proceeds and fails fast through its retry
 * loop). The sandbox mock session (honored on localhost / Lovable preview
 * hosts only) provides the "local user without a Supabase session"
 * starting state.
