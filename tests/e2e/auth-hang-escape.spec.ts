/**
 * Regression test for the "stuck on Preparing your map..." mainnet bug.
 *
 * A hung Pi.authenticate() (no resolve, no reject — what happens when the
 * Pi Browser approval sheet never comes back) used to leave
 * AuthenticatingOverlay mounted forever: appReady stayed false on the
 * timeout path, the retry loop re-ran the hung handshake, and the overlay
 * had no error state and no escape control.
 *
 * The fix: a slow-auth affordance with Cancel at 20s, a terminal 60s
 * timeout that surfaces an error card with Try again / Dismiss, and
 * appReady always settling so the overlay can never latch.
